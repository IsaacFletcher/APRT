This is an automated passive recon tool. It uses whois and nslookup to scan a domain. 
To use the program, just run the main.py file.
Then select the phase you want to scan a domain with and the domain itself.
nslookup option scans with almost all the ways nslookup can scan when only a domain is given. 
Dig will be available soon...

PS. If someone can help making the output "prettier" please don't hold back:D
